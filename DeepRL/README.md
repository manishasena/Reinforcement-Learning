Reinforcement Learning with Neural Networks.

First Jupyter notebook is results for assignment 2 of week 2 of Coursera: Prediction and Control with Function Approximation.

File RL_with_PyTorch_NN.py is an implementation of the system of Coursera, except testing our PyTorch for the Neural Network implementation.
